  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2\textendash 7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times\textemdash our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8\textendash 14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

  abstract = {Implementation of an error-corrected quantum computer is believed to require a quantum processor with a million or more physical qubits, and, in order to run such a processor, a quantum control system of similar scale will be required. Such a controller will need to be integrated within the cryogenic system and in close proximity with the quantum processor in order to make such a system practical. Here, we present a prototype cryogenic CMOS quantum controller designed in a 28-nm bulk CMOS process and optimized to implement a 16-word (4-bit) XY gate instruction set for controlling transmon qubits. After introducing the transmon qubit, including a discussion of how it is controlled, design considerations are discussed, with an emphasis on error rates and scalability. The circuit design is then discussed. Cryogenic performance of the underlying technology is presented, and the results of several quantum control experiments carried out using the integrated controller are described. This article ends with a comparison to the state of the art and a discussion of further research to be carried out. It has been shown that the quantum control IC achieves promising performance while dissipating less than 2 mW of total ac and dc power and requiring a digital data stream of less than 500 Mb/s.},

In this prospect, the development of scalable qubit readout schemes involving a minimal device overhead is a compelling step. Here we report the implementation of gate-coupled rf reflectometry for the dispersive readout of a fully functional spin qubit device. We use a p-type double-gate transistor made using industry-standard silicon technology. The first gate confines a hole quantum dot encoding the spin qubit, the second one a helper dot enabling readout. The qubit state is measured through the phase response of a lumped-element resonator to spin-selective interdot tunneling. The demonstrated qubit readout scheme requires no coupling to a Fermi reservoir, thereby offering a compact and potentially scalable solution whose operation may be extended above 1 K.},

  abstract = {High-fidelity single-shot readout of spin qubits requires distinguishing states much faster than the T1 time of the spin state. One approach to improving readout fidelity and bandwidth (BW) is cryogenic amplification, where the signal from the qubit is amplified before noise sources are introduced and room-temperature amplifiers can operate at lower gain and higher BW. We compare the performance of two cryogenic amplification circuits: a current-biased heterojunction bipolar transistor circuit (CB-HBT), and an AC-coupled HBT circuit (AC-HBT). Both circuits are mounted on the mixing-chamber stage of a dilution refrigerator and are connected to silicon metal oxide semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dot devices on a printed circuit board (PCB). The power dissipated by the CB-HBT ranges from 0.1 to 1\,{$\mu$}W whereas the power of the AC-HBT ranges from 1 to 20\,{$\mu$}W. Referred to the input, the noise spectral density is low for both circuits, in the 15 to 30 fA/\$\$\textbackslash sqrt\{\{\textbackslash bf\{Hz\}\}\}\$\$ range. The charge sensitivity for the CB-HBT and AC-HBT is 330\,{$\mu$}e/\$\$\textbackslash sqrt\{\{\textbackslash bf\{Hz\}\}\}\$\$ and 400\,{$\mu$}e/\$\$\textbackslash sqrt\{\{\textbackslash bf\{Hz\}\}\}\$\$, respectively. For the single-shot readout performed, less than 10\,{$\mu$}s is required for both circuits to achieve bit error rates below 10-3, which is a putative threshold for quantum error correction.},

  abstract = {Spin is a fundamental property of all elementary particles. Classically it can be viewed as a tiny magnetic moment, but a measurement of an electron spin along the direction of an external magnetic field can have only two outcomes1: parallel or anti-parallel to the field. This discreteness reflects the quantum mechanical nature of spin. Ensembles of many spins have found diverse applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging2 to magneto-electronic devices3, while individual spins are considered as carriers for quantum information. Read-out of single spin states has been achieved using optical techniques4, and is within reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy5. However, electrical read-out of single spins6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement of the state of an individual electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot14. We use spin-to-charge conversion of a single electron confined in the dot, and detect the single-electron charge using a quantum point contact; the spin measurement visibility is {$\sim$}65\%. Furthermore, we observe very long single-spin energy relaxation times (up to {$\sim$}0.85\,ms at a magnetic field of 8\,T), which are encouraging for the use of electron spins as carriers of quantum information.},

We next describe how logical qubits are formed in the surface code array and give numerical estimates of their fault tolerance. We outline how logical qubits are physically moved on the array, how qubit braid transformations are constructed, and how a braid between two logical qubits is equivalent to a controlled-not. We then describe the single-qubit Hadamard, \textasciicircum S and \textasciicircum T operators, completing the set of required gates for a universal quantum computer.

  abstract = {The canonical example of a quantum-mechanical two-level system is spin. The simplest picture of spin is a magnetic moment pointing up or down. The full quantum properties of spin become apparent in phenomena such as superpositions of spin states, entanglement among spins, and quantum measurements. Many of these phenomena have been observed in experiments performed on ensembles of particles with spin. Only in recent years have systems been realized in which individual electrons can be trapped and their quantum properties can be studied, thus avoiding unnecessary ensemble averaging. This review describes experiments performed with quantum dots, which are nanometer-scale boxes defined in a semiconductor host material. Quantum dots can hold a precise but tunable number of electron spins starting with 0, 1, 2, etc. Electrical contacts can be made for charge transport measurements and electrostatic gates can be used for controlling the dot potential. This system provides virtually full control over individual electrons. This new, enabling technology is stimulating research on individual spins. This review describes the physics of spins in quantum dots containing one or two electrons, from an experimentalist's viewpoint. Various methods for extracting spin properties from experiment are presented, restricted exclusively to electrical measurements. Furthermore, experimental techniques are discussed that allow for (1) the rotation of an electron spin into a superposition of up and down, (2) the measurement of the quantum state of an individual spin, and (3) the control of the interaction between two neighboring spins by the Heisenberg exchange interaction. Finally, the physics of the relevant relaxation and dephasing mechanisms is reviewed and experimental results are compared with theories for spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. All these subjects are directly relevant for the fields of quantum information processing and spintronics with single spins (i.e., single spintronics).},

The analysis of the capacitance lineshape as a function of externally controllable variables offers a way to characterize the qubits' charge and spin state as well as relevant system parameters such as charge and spin relaxation rates, tunnel coupling, electron temperature, and electron g factor. Overall, our analysis provides a formalism to understand dispersive qubit-resonator interactions which can be applied to high-sensitivity and noninvasive quantum-state readout.},

  abstract = {This article presents a fully integrated Cryo-CMOS system on chip (SoC) for quantum computing. The proposed SoC integrates a radio frequency (RF) pulse modulator for qubit state manipulation, a multi-tone signal generator and a coherent receiver for qubit state readout, and 22 DACs for high-speed voltage pulsing of qubit gates. By adopting frequency division multiplexing and direct digital synthesis (DDS), the RF pulse modulator can control up to 16 qubits over a single RF line, and the readout receiver can detect the state of up to six qubits simultaneously. The proposed SoC also integrates a microcontroller for low latency on-chip signal processing and increased flexibility in implementing quantum instruction sets. A detailed analysis of qubit-state readout fidelity and the impact of finite DAC resolution on two-qubit gate fidelity is also included in this article, together with an electrical specification summary. The SoC is implemented in Intel's 22 nm FFL fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) process, and it is characterized both at room and 4 K temperatures. The performance of each specific block is measured, with the readout characterized in a loop-back configuration. Generation of the control signals required for a full Rabi oscillation experiment is also demonstrated. This article also describes the cryogenic thermalization techniques used to integrate the SoC in the dilution refrigerator and shows temperature measurements during operation.},

Qubits that are defined using lithographic techniques have been suggested to enable the development of scalable quantum systems because they can be implemented using semiconductor fabrication technology2\textendash 5. However, leading solid-state approaches function only at temperatures below 100 millikelvin, where cooling power is extremely limited, and this severely affects the prospects of practical quantum computation. Recent studies of electron spins in silicon have made progress towards a platform that can be operated at higher temperatures by demonstrating long spin lifetimes6, gate-based spin readout7 and coherent single-spin control8. However, a high-temperature two-qubit logic gate has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that silicon quantum dots can have sufficient thermal robustness to enable the execution of a universal gate set at temperatures greater than one kelvin. We obtain single-qubit control via electron spin resonance and readout using Pauli spin blockade. In addition, we show individual coherent control of two qubits and measure single-qubit fidelities of up to 99.3 per cent. We demonstrate the tunability of the exchange interaction between the two spins from 0.5 to 18 megahertz and use it to execute coherent two-qubit controlled rotations. The demonstration of `hot' and universal quantum logic in a semiconductor platform paves the way for quantum integrated circuits that host both the quantum hardware and its control circuitry on the same chip, providing a scalable approach towards practical quantum information processing.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor spins are one of the few qubit realizations that remain a serious candidate for the implementation of large-scale quantum circuits. Excellent scalability is often argued for spin qubits defined by lithography and controlled via electrical signals, based on the success of conventional semiconductor integrated circuits. However, the wiring and interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are completely different from those for classical circuits, as individual direct current, pulsed and in some cases microwave control signals need to be routed from external sources to every qubit. This is further complicated by the requirement that these spin qubits currently operate at temperatures below 100\,mK. Here, we review several strategies that are considered to address this crucial challenge in scaling quantum circuits based on electron spin qubits. Key assets of spin qubits include the potential to operate at 1 to 4\,K, the high density of quantum dots or donors combined with possibilities to space them apart as needed, the extremely long-spin coherence times, and the rich options for integration with classical electronics based on the same technology.},

By operating the CMOS control circuits at cryogenic temperatures (cryo-CMOS), and hence in close proximity to the cryogenic solid-state qubits, a compact quantum-computing system can be achieved, thus promising scalability to the large number of qubits required in a practical application. This work presents a cryo-CMOS microwave signal generator for frequency-multiplexed control of 4 \texttimes{} 32 qubits (32 qubits per RF output). A digitally intensive architecture offering full programmability of phase, amplitude, and frequency of the output microwave pulses and a wideband RF front end operating from 2 to 20 GHz allow targeting both spin qubits and transmons. The controller comprises a qubit-phase-tracking direct digital synthesis (DDS) back end for coherent qubit control and a single-sideband (SSB) RF front end optimized for minimum leakage between the qubit channels. Fabricated in Intel 22-nm FinFET technology, it achieves a 48-dB SNR and 45-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) in a 1-GHz data bandwidth when operating at 3 K, thus enabling high-fidelity qubit control. By exploiting the on-chip 4096-instruction memory, the capability to translate quantum algorithms to microwave signals has been demonstrated by coherently controlling a spin qubit at both 14 and 18 GHz.},

A key challenge towards large-scale quantum computation is the interconnect complexity. In current solid-state qubit implementations, an important interconnect bottleneck appears between the quantum chip in a dilution refrigerator and the room-temperature electronics. Advanced lithography supports the fabrication of both control electronics and qubits in silicon using technology compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS)2. When the electronics are designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures, they can ultimately be integrated with the qubits on the same die or package, overcoming the `wiring bottleneck'3\textendash 6. Here we report a cryogenic CMOS control chip operating at 3 kelvin, which outputs tailored microwave bursts to drive silicon quantum bits cooled to 20 millikelvin. We first benchmark the control chip and find an electrical performance consistent with qubit operations of 99.99 per cent fidelity, assuming ideal qubits. Next, we use it to coherently control actual qubits encoded in the spin of single electrons confined in silicon quantum dots7\textendash 9 and find that the cryogenic control chip achieves the same fidelity as commercial instruments at room temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of the control chip by programming a number of benchmarking protocols, as well as the Deutsch\textendash Josza algorithm10, on a two-qubit quantum processor.

As with any qubit implementation, a crucial requirement is the ability to measure individual quantum states rapidly and with high fidelity. Since the signal from a single electron spin is minute, the different spin states are converted to different charge states3,4. Charge detection, so far, has mostly relied on external electrometers5\textendash 7, which hinders scaling to two-dimensional spin qubit arrays2,8,9. Alternatively, gate-based dispersive read-out based on off-chip lumped element resonators has been demonstrated10\textendash 13, but integration times of 0.2\textendash 2\,ms were required to achieve single-shot read-out14\textendash 16. Here, we connect an on-chip superconducting resonant circuit to two of the gates that confine electrons in a double quantum dot. Measurement of the power transmitted through a feedline coupled to the resonator probes the charge susceptibility, distinguishing whether or not an electron can oscillate between the dots in response to the probe power. With this approach, we achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of about six within an integration time of only 1\,{$\mu$}s. Using Pauli's exclusion principle for spin-to-charge conversion, we demonstrate single-shot read-out of a two-electron spin state with an average fidelity of {$>$}98\% in 6\,{$\mu$}s. This result may form the basis of frequency-multiplexed read-out in dense spin qubit systems without external electrometers, therefore simplifying the system architecture.},

  abstract = {Full-scale quantum computers require the integration of millions of quantum bits. The promise of leveraging industrial semiconductor manufacturing to meet this requirement has fueled the pursuit of quantum computing in silicon quantum dots. However, to date, their fabrication has relied on electron-beam lithography and, with few exceptions, on academic style lift-off processes. Although these fabrication techniques offer process flexibility, they suffer from low yield and poor uniformity. An important question is whether the processing conditions developed in the manufacturing fab environment to enable high yield, throughput, and uniformity of transistors are suitable for quantum dot arrays and do not compromise the delicate qubit properties. Here, we demonstrate quantum dots hosted at a 28Si/28SiO2 interface, fabricated in a 300 mm semiconductor manufacturing facility using all-optical lithography and fully industrial processing. As a result, we achieve nanoscale gate patterns with remarkable homogeneity. The quantum dots are well-behaved in the multi-electron regime, with excellent tunnel barrier control, a crucial feature for fault-tolerant two-qubit gates. Single-spin qubit operation using magnetic resonance reveals relaxation times of over 1 s at 1 Tesla and coherence times of over 3 ms, matching the quality of silicon spin qubits reported to date. The feasibility of high-quality qubits made with fully-industrial techniques strongly enhances the prospects of a large-scale quantum computer},
